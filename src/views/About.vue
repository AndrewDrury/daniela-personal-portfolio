              <p>My name's Daniela Ornelas. I'm an aspiring UX designer and a third-year Psychology student at York University, currently residing in Toronto, Canada. UX design combines all my passions: design, psychology, communication (I love talking to people!), and learning.</p>
              <p>When I’m not designing, I’m either listening to music, doing Muay Thai, reading Medium posts, looking for the best Italian food I can find in Toronto, or spending my time with friends and family.</p>

              <h3>Internship at TD Lab</h3>
              <p>TD Lab, located in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, has given me a hands-on learning experience that has introduced me to design, business, and technology. During my internship at TD, I designed apps to help Generation Z manage their finances to prepare for future student loans, payments and mortgages.</p>
